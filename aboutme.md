## About me

Hello! I'm Manogna Sreenivas. I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Vision at IISc. Earlier I worked as a Software Engineer at PathPartner Technology. Even earlier, I graduated with a BTech in EEE from NITK Surathkal. Curious and wanting to decode how machine learning models work. I believe they ain't really black boxes. After all we live in a probabilistic world and the artificial intelligence almost always about getting to meet human intelligence. 

### What do I like?

- Doodling once in a bluemoon :P
- Started learning some carnatic music
- Solve Rubik's cube-ish puzzles.
